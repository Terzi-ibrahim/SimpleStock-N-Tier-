# SimpleStock
Hi guys 

This project was developed to learn n-tier architecture and ASP.NET Core MVC.

My goal:

Create the Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and WebUI layers separately

Perform CRUD operations with EF Core and SQLite

Demonstrate the AutoMapper, Repository, and Service patterns

Create a simple Dashboard and management screens

This project demonstrates the fundamental software architecture principles they apply while learning and allows me to learn the fundamental building blocks for use in advanced projects.
